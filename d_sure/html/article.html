                            <h2>Can malware affect organisations?</h2>
                            <p>Four days after WannaCry affected more than 200,000 systems in 150 countries, some organisations were still not back to normality. Every day we hear about another hack. With more than 1 million cyber attacks happening every day, it’s safe to say, that cyber attacks are an increasing threat to our society.   <br><br>
                            So, what are they? Who are they targeting? And how can public sector organisations best protect themselves and their critical data? </p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li>
                                    <h4>What is malware? </h4>
                                    <p>Malware, often referred to as a ‘virus’, is software designed to disrupt your IT systems and cause chaos and upheaval. There are many types of malware. Some, like WannaCry, prevent you from accessing your files and can spread rapidly, locking your information out of reach until you pay a sum of money for its release. Others can cause systems to shut down, record, or even steal your data.  Disney have reported that they have been held to ransom by hackers threatening to release their latest Pirates of the Caribbean series blockbuster. </p>
                                   <p> There are many types of malware – Trojans, viruses, worms and bots, spyware, ransomware and adware. The list is pretty endless and with cyber attacks on the increase, so is the threat. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Who is affected by malware? </h4>
                                    <p>Malware can affect anyone and everyone. Different types of malware infect systems differently and can spread in many ways. WannaCry spread through a flaw in Microsoft software and affected small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as giants such as Renault, Deutsche Bahn and even Russia’s Interior Ministry. In fact, if you have a computer, or anything powered by a computer, you need to protect your IT against possible malware attacks. </p>
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <h4>How can I protect myself from a malware attack? </h4>
                                    <p>Stay secure with cloud-based software In years gone by, computer security used to mean a visit to a PC store where you’d buy a box containing software purporting to magically defend systems against all manner of threats. One installation and that would be it. For years, if we wanted. </p>
                                    <p>To protect ourselves against the latest threats we’d have to manually check for updates or invest in a newer version.</p>
                                    <p>Time consuming, unreliable and costly. It’s not hard to see why so many organisations are moving towards cloud-based software.</p>
                                    <p>The latest backup software solutions are cloud based and are substantially more powerful. Acronis® Backup 12.5 doesn’t just detect malware but also stops it in its tracks with its Active Protection, and the restores any compromised data in moments, delivering backup and protection in one go. It isn’t just about anti-malware solutions though. </p>
                                    <p>Keeping other software up to date is essential too. It was a flaw in an old Microsoft product that made it possible for WannaCry to infect computers across the globe. Had the patch, already issued by Microsoft been installed, the malware would’ve crashed and burned. </p>
                                    <p>When you use cloud-based software such as Microsoft 365, software patches are installed automatically, saving time, providing more reliable cover, and keeping your computers and IT infrastructure safe from the latest risks. The onus is on the software provider to issue regular updates to protect us against the latest threats. </p>
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Back up to avoid disaster </h4>
                                    <p>With new threats evolving all the time, it’s not possible to safeguard yourself 100% but by backing up your systems, you can ensure that if you are hacked, you won’t be find yourself over a barrel, needing to pay a ransom fee to be able to open your doors in the morning.  Inspections won’t be compromised and your staff won’t find themselves prevented from accessing critical policies or templates. </p>
                                    <p>Backing up your systems needn’t be laborious and time consuming. Acronis’ award-winning backup technology can back up anything in a single step so you’ll be able to store any file, folder or even an entire server. So, should the worst happen, you’ll be able to access your data and files within minutes, not days or even weeks.</p>
